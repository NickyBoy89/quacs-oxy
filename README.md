## About

QuACS OXY is a fork of the open-source [Questionably Accurate Course Scheduler](https://quacs.org/) (QuACS) project originally built by [students](https://github.com/quacs/quacs/graphs/contributors) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, but tailored specifically for Occidental College.

## Purpose

QuACS OXY aims to replace one of the most annoying steps of planning your courses for the semester, writing down every course and trying to find times that make them all work.

> [!WARNING]
> QuACS OXY is not a replacement for [Course Counts](https://counts.oxy.edu/), and if in doubt about anything, always refer to Course Counts

## Usage

Using the application should be simple.

1. Navigate to the website at <placeholder>, and start adding courses from the front page, or the search bar.
2. Once you are finished adding all your courses, or a subset of your courses, click on the "Schedule" button in the top right.
3. Once you are viewing your schedule, click the arrow keys at the top to cycle between all possible schedules for your courses, and choose the one that appeals most to you!
